# GDPR (simplified) — policy (mock)

This is a simplified, hackathon-friendly policy summary for automated checks.

## Key rules

1. **Minimize personal data exposure**
   - Don’t share names, emails, phone numbers, addresses, IDs in public/broad channels.
   - Use redaction/anonymization where possible.

2. **Access control**
   - Personal data must not be accessible via “anyone with the link”.
   - Restrict sharing to least privilege.
   - User must have right to remove their data.
   - User must be informed if their user data is used to train Machine Learning model. 

3. **Purpose limitation**
   - Don’t store personal data in tooling artifacts (PRs/issues/tickets) unless required.

4. **Retention**
   - Keep personal data only as long as needed and ensure documentation matches actual retention.

## What counts as personal data (examples)

- Email addresses (e.g. `john@example.com`)
- Phone numbers (e.g. `+44 20 1234 5678`)
- Full names combined with identifiers
