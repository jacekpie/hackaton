# Data Retention — policy (mock)

## Key rules

1. **Retain only as long as necessary**
   - Do not keep personal data beyond defined retention periods.
2. **Documentation accuracy**
   - Stated retention in policy docs must match actual system retention settings.
3. **Deletion**
   - Ensure deletion is possible and performed when retention expires.
