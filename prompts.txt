We are building a platform for 
Continuous Compliance Monitoring Across Workflows.


Problem statement: 
How might organisations detect compliance risks as work happens rather than after the fact? Compliance checks are often manual and retrospective. How might we build a live layer that monitors actions, communications, or documents against defined rules and flags issues early?

Key Issues for Founder to Explore:
Translating policies into machine-readable rules
Managing false positives vs missed risks
Alerting vs automated remediation
Updating rules as requirements change

How to we envison that: 
We wpuld to build this platform using llm agents. 
It would scan resources withing the organisation and scan for compliance risks.
It would scan resources like: 
1. google drive for documents and spreadsheets
2. Github for code 
3. Slach for messages

We would like start with gdpr as the first compliance risk. 
How do we see the system - 
therwe is one central dashboard with lsit of found complican risks
The list ocompliances should work like email for everyon - there 
is a clear serparation between read and unread compliance risks. 
The lsit of complkiance risks should dominate the dashobard. 
There should be a lsit of sources on the left side of the dasdhboard. 
WE would like the frontent to be build uisng react and typescrip.
Please use the current directory as the main project directory. 

Please boilerplate the frontend for the project. 
Pelase use shadcn and npm in the current directory.
